# sgseq_cwl

A set of CWL workflows for running the BioConductor SGSeq package

The main intent of this project is to allow for running [SGSeq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SGSeq.html) for many samples, using the [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/) specification.

This is under development - documentation and examples forthcoming.
